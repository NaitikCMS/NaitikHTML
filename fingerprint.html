<div class="box-1"><h3 text="main">Information</h3><p>Fingerprints are unique patterns of friction ridges on the fingers and thumbs that are used for personal identification. These patterns, which are present from birth and do not change over time, are made up of raised ridges and valleys. Fingerprints are considered a reliable form of biometrics, meaning they are used to identify and authenticate individuals. 
Key aspects of fingerprints:
Uniqueness:
No two people, not even identical twins, have the same fingerprints. 
Permanence:
Fingerprint patterns are formed in utero and remain stable throughout life, unless there is severe damage to the deep skin layers. 
Friction Ridges:
Fingerprints are made up of raised ridges and valleys, which are part of the friction ridge skin. 
Biometric Identification:
Fingerprints are a key component of biometric identification systems, which are used for authentication and access control. 
Forensic Evidence:
Fingerprints are valuable forensic evidence in crime investigations, helping to identify suspects and link individuals to crime scenes. 
History of Use:
Fingerprints have been used for identification purposes for centuries, dating back to 1000 BC. 
Classification:
Fingerprints are classified into different patterns, such as arches, loops, and whorls. 
Minutiae:
Unique details within the fingerprint patterns, known as minutiae, help to distinguish one fingerprint from another.   </p>
